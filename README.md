**Spirimon Battle Test** is a small vertical slice of a Pokemon-style monster catching game. 
It allows players in its current form to test the basics of the battle system inside a test environment hosted by Unity Play, 
allowing anyone with a modern, up-to-date web browser with WebAssembly to participate.
This repo controls the central storage of project files, and the test is hosted on Unity Play, which will be linked below.
To play the Battle Test, simply click the Unity Play link and go.

<mark style="background-color: red">NOTE: </mark>If Unity Play gets stuck at 0%, it is often because either the browser security settings are blocking scripts from loading, or WebAssembly is not enabled. Try with a different browser and see if it works.
